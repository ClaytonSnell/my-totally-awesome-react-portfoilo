# my-totally-awsome-react-portfoilo

## Description

This assignment put together skills we learned while studying React. In this assignment I built components/pages and linked that information via exporting and inputs.
I used reactstrap to put toghether a header and footer, followed by building pages. I used trail and error to try and piece a decent portfolio together. I still think I need a ton of work on my coding. Now that this class is over and I have a certificate I intend to go back through every assignment while I look for work. I feel this hits all the required fields for the technical
criteria, other than I've replaced screenshots of application with random pictures. This assignment started by doing npx create-react-app, and linking the live to to gh-pages. I'm still not even sure what the gh-pages does, but I feel like there is alot more to learn and I'm just scratching the surface of what can be done. I'm going to continue working on this assignment as I intend to 
use it for job search in the future.
